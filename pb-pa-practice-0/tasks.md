## Grocery Store Database

We have gorceries listed in a table.
For each grocery we display the amount (quantity) and
whether it's a vegetable or a fruit (type).

We already implemented a button that replaces the one-letter-type with the full name.

## Task 1

When the user clicks on "Highlight Even Quantities",
the table cells that have an even number of quantity
in them should have a blue background.

## Task 2

When the user clicks on "Total grocery count",
the sum of quantities of all groceries should show up in
the span that has the id `total-count`.

## Task 3

When the user clicks on the "Search" button, all gorecy names that
match the input (id="search") should change to red and every
other name should be written with black.
